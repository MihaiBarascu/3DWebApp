          Hello, I'm Mihai, a passionate developer with a strong enthusiasm for
          both <span className="font-bold">front-end</span> and{" "}
          <span className="font-bold">back-end</span> development. I enjoy
          working on all aspects of web development, from building intuitive
          user interfaces to creating powerful, efficient server-side systems.

          Throughout my journey as a developer, Iâ€™ve realized that nothing is
          more rewarding than seeing a functional product come to life.
          Overcoming challenges, whether it's debugging tricky issues or solving
          unexpected roadblocks, gives me a deep sense of accomplishment and
          fuels my passion for coding.

          Currently, I am focused on improving my knowledge in full-stack
          development, continually learning and applying my skills in real-world
          projects. I'm excited to keep progressing and to face new challenges
          that come my way.
